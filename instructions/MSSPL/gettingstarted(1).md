# Getting Started with Azure AI Services

## Overall Estimated Duration: 4 Hours

## Overview

Azure AI services offer a comprehensive set of tools that allow you to integrate intelligent features into your applications, such as image recognition, text analysis, and language processing. With services like Azure AI services, Azure Machine Learning, and Azure OpenAI, you can leverage advanced AI capabilities to streamline workflows, solve complex problems, and enhance the functionality of your applications. These services enable you to build powerful AI-driven solutions, making it easier to address real-world challenges and drive innovation in the cloud.

## Objective

This lab is designed to equip participants with hands-on experience in exploring Azure AI services, such as Computer Vision and Azure AI services, to enhance applications with capabilities like image recognition, text analysis, and speech processing.

-   **Analyze Images with Azure AI Computer Vision:** Implement an Azure AI services resource to analyze images using the Computer Vision service. Configure and run a client app to extract captions, objects, and tags for visual insights.
-   **Detect Objects with Azure AI Custom Vision:** Azure AI’s Custom Vision service allows you to build and deploy image recognition models tailored to your needs. It supports image classification and object detection, enabling you to label images, train models, and test their accuracy without requiring machine learning expertise.
-   **Analyze Images with Azure AI Face API:** Azure AI’s Face API provides advanced algorithms for detecting, recognizing, and analyzing human faces in images. It supports various functionalities such as face detection, verification, identification, and grouping, making it useful for applications like identity verification, touchless access control, and privacy protection through automatic face blurring.
-   **Translate Text and Audio with Azure AI Translator:** Azure AI Translator is a cloud-based neural machine translation service that enables you to translate text and documents across more than 100 languages using a simple REST API call. It supports various use cases, such as real-time translation for call centers, multilingual conversational agents, and in-app communication.

## Prerequisites

Participants should have the following prerequisites:

-   **Basic Understanding of Cloud Computing:** Familiarity with fundamental cloud concepts and services, particularly in the context of Microsoft Azure.
-   **Knowledge of Azure AI Services:** Understanding the Azure AI services suite, including how to provision and use services like Computer Vision, Custom Vision, Azure AI Translator, and Azure AI Face.
-   **Experience with the Azure Portal**: Proficiency in navigating and using the Azure Portal to manage and configure cloud resources.
-   **Familiarity with PowerShell or Cloud Shell:** Basic knowledge of using PowerShell or Cloud Shell for running commands and scripts within Azure.
-   **Basic Programming Knowledge:** Understanding of scripting or programming languages like PowerShell, used for configuring and running client applications in Azure.
-   **Understanding of APIs and Endpoints:** Familiarity with how to interact with APIs and use endpoints for connecting to services in Azure.
-   **Knowledge of Security Best Practices:** Awareness of security principles related to cloud services, including handling keys, authentication, and securing resources.

## Architecture

The lab architecture leverages various Microsoft Azure services and tools to provide hands-on experience with cloud computing, AI, and security practices. Using the Azure portal, users can provision and manage resources like **Azure AI services**, which include **Custom Vision**, **Face API**, and **Azure AI services multi-service**. PowerShell, or Cloud Shell, executes scripts for provisioning and managing these resources. The lab encourages interaction with APIs and endpoints to connect client applications with Azure services, enabling real-time data processing and analysis. Additionally, a focus on security best practices ensures proper handling of authentication, keys, and resource protection. Participants will build, deploy, and test AI models and applications for various use cases, such as image recognition, face detection, and language translation while developing a deeper understanding of cloud architecture, AI tools, and secure cloud operations.
